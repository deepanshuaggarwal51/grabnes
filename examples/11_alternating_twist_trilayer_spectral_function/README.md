# 11: Alternating-twist trilayer graphene, unfolded spectral function

The spectral function of alternating-twist trilayer graphene at 6.01 degrees:
three layers in which the middle one is twisted against the two outer ones (546
atoms, `(m, n) = (6, 5)`, structure read from files as in example 09). The
states of the moire cell are unfolded on the graphene lattice, one layer at a
time, along a cut through the Dirac points of the outer layers and of the middle
layer.

## Expected result

![11: Alternating-twist trilayer graphene, unfolded spectral function](reference/spectral_function.png)

This is the figure `plot.py` draws from the reference data. After `./run.sh`, `python3 plot.py`
writes `spectral_function.png` in this folder from your own run; the two figures should look the same.

## What to look for

- The middle layer has its Dirac cone at `K2`, the two outer layers at `K1`.
- The outer layers show two cones at `K1`, with different velocities. The trilayer has a mirror symmetry: the
  odd combination of the outer layers is a graphene cone that does not couple to the middle layer,
  and the even combination forms a twisted-bilayer-like system with it. Layers 1 and 3 give the same
  picture.
- This is why the middle layer has a single cone at `K2` and no second one.

## The reference lattice

`Spectral.Path` is given in fractional coordinates of a graphene lattice with
`a1` along x, whatever the cell. `Calculate.Spectral` projects on plane waves
of that lattice, so the result is the spectral function of a layer only if the
layer has that orientation:

| Layer | Orientation | Keys that make it the reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 and 3 | along the reference lattice | none |
| 2 | rotated by minus the twist angle | `Spectral.AlignReferenceSystem .true.`, `Spectral.AlignmentAngle` = minus the twist angle |

The cut of this example passes through both Dirac points, so it shows all layers
in one run. For other twist angles the coordinates of `K2` in `Spectral.Path`
change: `K2` is `K1 = (2/3, 1/3)` rotated by minus the twist angle.

## Energy units

- `Spectral.Emin` and `Spectral.Emax` are in eV since 2026-10-30. They were in units of `TB.Hopping`
  before, so older inputs must multiply them by `TB.Hopping`; a warning in `job.out` says so.
- The energy column of the output files is still in units of `TB.Hopping` (3.5 eV here). `plot.py`
  multiplies it back to eV.
- `Spectral.energyGridResolution` is in eV: a state adds its weight to every energy point closer than
  this. If the points are more than twice that apart, states fall between them and are missing from
  the output; the run prints a warning in that case.

## Output

`generate.spectral<layer><sublattice>`, for example `generate.spectral2A`, with
columns distance along the path [1/A], energy [`TB.Hopping`] and weight. The
sublattices of a layer are added here without their relative phase. The weight
is not normalized: at a k-point where one layer's state unfolds completely, A
and B together carry half the number of atoms of the layer.

## The model and the check

The model of example 09 (F2G2 intralayer, two-center interlayer with factor
1.008 on a rigid lattice, `Stack.ThreeLayers`, `Stack.MiddleTwist`). This is
direct diagonalization at every k-point: the plane-wave reduction of example 09
is not used.

Checked in October 2026 on the cell `(m, n) = (3, 2)` with the layers decoupled
(`Interlayer.CouplingFactor 0`), against the same model on the primitive cell,
on the same k-points and energy points: in both directions, 94 of 94 levels
within 10.5 eV, for each of the three layers. Each layer agrees only with the
reference lattice of its own orientation, and not with the other one. The result
of this example is the same with GNU and Intel Fortran at the precision of the
output.

## Other twist angles

`python3 make_structure.py m n` writes another commensurate cell. Near the magic
angle, the default `(m, n) = (22, 21)` of that script has 8322 atoms. Each
k-point then takes a dense diagonalization of that size, minutes on a cluster
node, so it is not a calculation for this example. With relaxed structures use
factor 0.895.

## Run

```sh
./run.sh
python3 plot.py
```

`run.sh` writes the structure for `(m, n) = (6, 5)` when the files are missing.
The calculation takes about 30 seconds on four cores. It writes
`generate.spectral*` and `job.out`; the plotting step writes
`spectral_function.png`. If no calculated file exists, the plotter uses
`reference/spectral.dat`.
